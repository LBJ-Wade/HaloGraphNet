# HaloGraphNet

Predict halo masses from simulations via graph neural networks 

UNDER DEVELOPMENT

## Scripts

Here is a brief description of the codes included:

- `main.py`: train and test the network.

- `hyperparams_tunning.py`: optimize the hyperparameters using optuna.

- `plot_out_true.py`: plot predicted versus true halo masses.

In the folder `Source`, several auxiliary routines are defined:

* `params.py`: constants and parameters to be set by the user.

* `routines.py`: includes some useful functions, such as routines for training the net.

* `load_data.py`: contains routines to load data from simulation files.

* `networks.py`: includes the definition of the networks architectures.
